Analytic Approach Based on the Question Type
When choosing an analytic approach for a problem, the type of question you’re trying to answer greatly influences the methodology. Here are five common types of questions and corresponding analytic approaches:

1. Descriptive Questions: “What is the current status?”
Approach: Descriptive Analytics

Question:  "What is the current status of our sales?"  

Techniques:

Data aggregation: Combining data from various sources into a unified view.

Data mining: Extracting useful information from large datasets.

Data visualization: Using visual tools to present data in an easily understandable format.

Examples:

Summarizing sales data

Creating dashboards

Generating reports


2. Diagnostic Questions: “Why did it happen?”
Approach: Diagnostic Analytics

Question: "Why did our sales decline in the last quarter?"  

Techniques:

Drill-down: Exploring detailed data to find underlying causes.

Data discovery: Identifying patterns and relationships in data.

Correlation analysis: Assessing the relationship between different variables.

Examples:

Identifying root causes of sales decline

Analyzing customer complaints

Understanding failure points in a process


3. Predictive Questions: “What is likely to happen?”
Approach: Predictive Analytics

Question: "What is our sales forecast for the next year?"  

Techniques:

Regression analysis: Predicting outcomes based on relationships between variables.

Time series forecasting: Predicting future values based on past trends.

Machine learning models: Using algorithms to predict future outcomes based on historical data.

Examples:

Forecasting sales

Predicting customer churn

Estimating future demand


4. Prescriptive Questions: “What should we do?”
Approach: Prescriptive Analytics

Question: "What should we do to increase website traffic?"  

Techniques:

Optimization models: Finding the best solution from a set of alternatives.

Simulation: Modeling scenarios to predict outcomes.

Decision analysis: Evaluating and comparing different decisions.

Examples:

Recommending inventory levels

Optimizing marketing campaigns

Determining pricing strategies


5. Classification Questions: “Which category does this belong to?”
Approach: Classification (Supervised Learning)

Question: "Which category does this data point belong to?"   

Techniques:

Logistic regression: Predicting the probability of a categorical outcome.

Decision trees: Splitting data into branches to classify it.

Support vector machines: Finding the best boundary to separate categories.

Neural networks: Using interconnected nodes to classify data.

Examples:

Email spam detection

Image classification

Disease diagnosis


Understanding these different types of questions and the corresponding analytic approaches can help you unlock your data's true potential.
